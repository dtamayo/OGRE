/*! @brief This class defines the group of possible dialogs that pop up when the user wants to add an action to the queue.

    When the user selects an action type from the dropdown menu on the top right of the queue, an instance of this class is created (see @ref
    RobD::MainWindow::launchAddActionDialog()).  This class implements all the different dialogs that should be launched, corresponding to the
    different actions.

    All actions to be added to the queue will ask for a span (time over which action should be performed), as well as the row after which the action should
    be inserted.  The other spinboxes are given generic names since they will represent different quantities depending on the action selected.
